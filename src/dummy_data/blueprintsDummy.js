What is Java? Java is an object-oriented programming language that runs on almost all electronic devices and is the most common language used by web developers. Java is platform-independent because of Java virtual machines (JVMs). It follows the principle of "write once, run everywhere.” When a JVM is installed on the host operating system, it automatically adapts to the environment and executes the program’s functionalities.  To install Java on a computer, the developer must download the JDK and set up the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Java offers many benefits, which we will explore in detail.'
